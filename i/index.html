        a poem by tes</p>
    <p>
        nothing in this world matters as much<br>
        i feel so much; there is such movement in the feelings i feel<br>
        you... immense and endless, so, so much to feel and hold and worship<br>
        no matter who I am, no matter what is spat on my face and mashed into my eyes<br>
        no matter what; you, endless plane of life, all of you, everywhere,<br>
        I LOVE YOU.<br>
        and yes, you hate me for whatever reason you choose, and you need only touch me to fear,<br>
        i love you.<br>
        as much as you attempt to destroy me, i want to believe that essense will remain.<br>
        there is no hell deeper than the one you have made for me.<br>
        just let me lie, and love.
    </p>
