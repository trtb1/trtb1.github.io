    this is a new site hehe i think itll be filled with secret stuff and fun things for friends and kool nifty trix and fun stuff like tht :D
    
    gm again sir i thought itd be easier to talk up here i understand sir and i didnt wanna bother you -- i happen to know that he had his secratary remove some files -- i hate to say this sir but i think hastings may have been doctoring those accounts... i certainly understand sir youll certainly need time to think ...
    
    uh sorry my columbo came out hehe nvmd; i want to know what this episode was about, it feels so... nasty and weird somehow. it feels like everyones very stupid and yet also drowning in fifteen layers of irony and innuendo. oliver- ive never understood about business. no. and i don't think i want to. 

    im going to a pals place tmrw :) itll be rlly fun and super chummy and friendly. :D they have a cat named chairman! and hes really funny lookng... he has a raccoon tail!! :o and this one time! we found a bug on the ground and i was about to squish it and see its insides flow like wine from a barrel to flood its soul with esquisite cessation... and I poised, my body, my instrument of death raised to compress form and function into useless limp substance, into final wine...

    And my friend struck me across the face. They took me by the wrists and they confronted that resident demon within me to attempt to cure me. And I, demon, so soon and small, rising; I, tes, name already chosen, spake: "you may never remove me, child. for you are far more consumed than i. silly child; i am not taken by consumation! i am myself! 
    
    "i am a black moon rising over the water of my eyes." 

    And so, after night fell and all slumbered, so I, barely seven years old at the time, rose from my bed entangled from my friends and crossed the reeded fields. And my feet, steeled by the cold and hair flying through the wind. And so endeth the insect.

    hallo. i wen to pals hous yesserday. was fun. we discussed our differing theologic and literaturic standpoints; both of which it seems we will die on. refreshing. concerning, also: my friend seems to be supremely concerned with the internal, and less with the interpersonal side of the human condition. i respect this, i suppose. is fair, each human may be granted their unique vantagepoint. I disagree with these things, however. I feel they should be controlled. I feel that humanity as a whole may be largely controlled by overwhelmingly barraging the world with kindness with well-buried ill-will. humanity is a disgusting race; i am no less disgusting and useless. ily.
