    a poem by tes</p>
    <p>
        seethe. <br>
        breathe through your anger, feel it scrape against your teeth and ruin you.<br>
        your anger will burn the leaves to make room for ice.<br>
        *<br>
        seethe.<br>
        unearth every hatchet which lies in the soil of each soul.<br>
        they will cleave you too.<br>
        *<br>
        seethe.<br>
        and let it soothe you. never fear:<br>
        you have already shown me. <br>
        I have already shown you. <br>
        I was born in flowers, and now I consume them.
