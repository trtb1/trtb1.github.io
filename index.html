    <p id="spc">welcome to .trtb1.</p>

    <p>this is .TRTB.'s secret site. It's a secret site. you're not supposed to be here. :)</p>

    <p>here there will be snippets from multiple things which "TRTB" has created. INFO: "TRTB" is not the core of ".THE.ARTIST.", and that's okay. you likely will never reach the core. this is only a piece of ".THE.ARTIST."'s lore. this is as boring to write as it is to read. ".TRTB." apologizes. hehe.</p>
