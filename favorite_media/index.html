    <p>nvmd html tables are bullcrap uhh well I suppose I like lady in the darkest hour, I like Giliad, a novel, and I don't like movies, and I have a very healthy obsession with columbo /srs... uh and I hate oneyplays but the fact is that it's literally the only thing that can make me sleep, and as horrible as it is, I would be very sad if you judged me :(( I disagree with the things they say and i really hate them actually even though they are literally just joking; they say really horrid things and are extremely desensitized and had pretty horrid childhoods and found solace in the wild west of early-2000's net stuff, which I suppose you're a bit connected to if you're reading this so ok but anyway whatever, I enjoy very specific kinds of er*t*ca; I like the relaxing stuff, really, and I am ace but like it's really relaxing (I'm s*x-positive and enjoy mild er*t*ca) but only occasionally and I forget it exists once in a while which is perfectly okay! it's alr to be ace and to enjoy other things. anyway, I like media that I've read (or seen, but rarer) at least a hundred times. When I was younger, I read Peter and Wendy, the children's novel, almost 400 times. I loved it very much, and when I read it now that I'm an old person, I find that I still love it. I still enjoy british children's literature. Authors there at that time took great solace in the peace and simplicity of childhood after the war. I respect that. Others, a bit later, started to embrace the more dark sides of childhood, especially the next generation, such as Dahl. His works were not as innocent. Still childish, but with a respect for how horrible childhood can be. His genius wasn't his funny words, his amazing characters; it was his use of contrast between joy and dispair. One can't have true joy, says Dahl, without total, stark dispair. That taught me a great deal. You can actually <em>enjoy</em> dispair in Dahl's writing. It can be just as comforting as the most euphoric moments of his joy. I'll go to bed now. gn. Ily and thank you for reading.</p>
